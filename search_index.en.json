Coming from the .NET world with only solutions and projects, it was not super clear from the get-go how to organize this project.\nAs with many software projects, the main goals were:\n\nclear separation between components\nclarity to which component depends on which\nsome way of testing each component individually\n(and many more I'm sure)\n\nThe way I see the database project is split into these large chunks:\n\na storage engine\na query execution engine\na query planner and optimization engine (optionally part of the query engine)\na front end (parser, binder, etc)\ncross cutting elements (transactions, locks, etc)\na server component\na binary to bind them all together\nextra tools: client apps, drivers, etc\n\nTo try to achieve this, I've defined one workspace with the following components:\n\nExcept for the main trdb binary crate which is stored at the root level, everything is stored under the crates folder, with subfolders based on the specific component. The trdb crate might also act as the server implementation since it has a library crate inside as well, I have not decided yet.\nThe only crates that have been actually created so far are the ones under the storage engine, so the others might get renamed, reorganized, split or merged.\nBut the main idea was to separate each major component of the engine into its own folder, where it can be broken down into separate crates if needed, and each component should expose an -api crate that will be the only point of access to that module.\nThe reason for breaking them apart into separate crates was mostly from an organizational point of view - I don't particularly like folders with a lot of files/subfolders underneath. I'll have to see if this split was too granular (or maybe too coarse, though I doubt that). As of right now, only part of the page crate is implemented, so only time will tell.\n","description":"Organizing a project of this scale is already difficult - doing it in a new language, where you are not familiar with the idiomatic ways of structuring the project makes it even trickier","id":"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/crates/","path":"/blog/rusting-a-database/crates/","title":"Crates"},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/insertion-in-heap-pages/":{"body":"Intro\nInsertion in heap pages is, in theory, straightforward: you find some free space in the page, place the row there and create a slot pointing to that location. There are, however, multiple small details that make things a bit more complicated (mostly edge cases caused by fragmentation).\nThe implementation in TRDB is very similar to the one in Java - I mostly covered some scenarios I had missed there &amp; cleaned it up a bit, making it more granular and easier to test.\nI will mostly cover the overall logic and reasoning behind it, limitations &amp; possible improvements.\nHigh level\nFrom a high level, the insertion is done in two separate steps:\n\nplan the insertion\nperform the actual insertion\n\nThe planning phase looks for a location for the new row, along with metadata for the insertion algorithm. No data is changed during this phase, it is a read-only operation.\nThe insertion phase uses the metadata provided in the plan to actually place the row at the target position and to update the header &amp; slot array\nPlanning phase\nThis phase attempts to answer several questions about where the row is going to end up and what other changes are needed to the page from a maintenance point of view:\n\nwhat slot number will the row use?\nwhere is it going to be physically placed?\nis compaction needed for this insert?\n\nSlot number\nThe first step of the planning is to go through the slot array and look for any unused slots. As a reminder: when a record is deleted its slot is only being invalidated, but kept in the array. The insertion algorithm will reuse these empty slots, to avoid increasing the footprint of the slot array unnecessarily.\nThe scan starts from the beginning of the array (rightmost element) and stops at the first unused slot it encounters. If no such slot is found, it flags that a new one will be needed.\nPhysical location\nIn the second step of the planning, we look for a place to physically place the row itself in the page.\nThis is done by checking the following conditions, in this order:\n\nCan the row fit in the free space? (free_end - free_start)\nCan the row fit between two existing rows?\nCan the row fit between the last row and free_start?\n\nThe options are probed one by one, halting at the first positive answer. If none are successful, the algorithm flags that a compaction is needed for this insertion.\nNotes\n\nPrior to this phase, an additional check is done to ensure that the row can physically fit in the page - meaning that there are enough free bytes in the page, regardless of fragmentation; if there are not, the entire flow is aborted. This allows us to have the fallback of compaction (we can be sure that if we could not find a large enough spot right now, there will be one once we compact)\nAll checks are done with the information from the first phase in mind - if a new slot is needed, 4 extra bytes are taken into account when determining the necessary overall space in the page.\n\nImplementation\nThe actual result of the planning phase is represented as an enum comprised of two other enums (code):\n\nInsertion phase\nThis is pretty straight forward: based on the insertion plan received from the previous step, it will know exactly whether it needs to compact the page beforehand, at what offset to place the row and how to handle the slot.\nBesides inserting the actual row data and updating the slot array, the following header values are also updated:\n\nSLOT_COUNT - incremented by 1 only if we are creating a new slot\nFREE_END - decremented by SLOT_SIZE only if we are creating a new slot\nFREE_START - incremented by row.size only if we are inserting at this location (meaning we are not using a gap between two rows)\nFREE_SPACE - always updated. Decremented by row.size if we are reusing a slot, or by row.size + SLOT_SIZE if we are also creating a new slot.\n\nReasoning\nThe initial implementation in Java was a single step insert - it worked ok, despite it becoming a bit too bloated. However, I had to split it into these two phase once I started working on write-ahead logging (WAL).\nAs the name suggests, in WAL you need to create a log entry with the operation that is going to happen, meaning you need to have all the information about the change you are about to make before you perform the change. This was problematic because one of the fields that had to be included in the log entry was the slot number of the row being inserted - value which was only known during/after the insertion, not before.\nSince it is not acceptable to write an incomplete WAL entry and update it afterward, the only choice was to extract the logic that determined the physical location of the row outside the actual insertion, allowing me to (1) generate the insertion plan, (2) log the operation and (3) perform the actual insert.\nI could have, of course, updated the insert method to perform the log internally, right before it placed the row in the page. However, I preferred to have the Page implementation unaware of the WAL and not couple the two in this manner.\nPossible improvements\nDuring the search for a physical location in the planning phase, because the checks being performed are short-circuiting, their order is relevant and up for debate:\n\non one hand the current implementation favors fragmentation, because it will only attempt to fill in gaps if the free_end - free_start area is not large enough.  However, it avoids scanning the existing slots if it is not necessary, thus providing a quicker response.\non the other hand, switching those two would reduce overall fragmentation, but would also incur useless scans of the slot array for scenarios where the fragmentation is low (which is also kept low by this algorithm)\ndon't think there is a right or wrong, although implementing them both and doing some benchmarking would be the only way of telling for sure\n\nit is also highly influenced by access patterns: tables with low deletions would benefit from the current implementation, while tables with lots of inserts &amp; deletes could benefit from the second one\n\n\n\nAnother area of improvement is also during the planning phase: as of right now, the two steps in the planning phase scan over the slot array twice: once for the slot # and once for the physical location. It can be done in a single pass, but for now I chose clarity and testability over efficiency. Again, only some benchmarks could give us a performance penalty for this implementation.\n","description":"Implementation of the insertion algorithm for unsorted heap pages","id":"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/insertion-in-heap-pages/","path":"/blog/rusting-a-database/insertion-in-heap-pages/","title":"insertion in heap pages"},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/maintaining-stable-row-identifiers-during-page-maintenance/":{"body":"intro\nChristmas, New Year's, a 1-week ski trip, time with family, the rabbit hole of a full re-organization of my Obsidian vault into a Zettelkasten slip box after reading How to take smart notes - all of these resulted in me making far less progress on this project than I would have expected, especially during my 3-week winter vacation. Nevertheless, there has been some progress.\nI am still within the storage system, working on the slotted pages for heaps and there have been a few interesting things I have encountered around the way a database engine will handle certain page maintenance operations.\nrow IDs\nMost systems (though here I am mainly knowledgeable about how SQL Server handles things) will use a row ID to internally identify a row.\nA row ID can be considered any identifier that allows the system to uniquely identify a single row. There can be multiple places where the engine would need to store this identifier, but maybe the best example is a non-clustered (or secondary) index. In here, each index entry will contain a pointer to the full row it belongs to. When retrieving rows based on that non-clustered index, the row identifier is used to obtain the full row (if needed).\nhow SQL Server does it\nIn the case of SQL Server, row IDs used in non-clustered indexes depend on the source table, and it is usually referred to as the 'row bookmark value' (Delaney et al., 2013, p. 308):\n\nif the source table is clustered, the non-clustered indexes will use the clustering key as the row identifier\nif the source table is a heap, the non-clustered index will use a physical row locator to identify the row\n\nToday we are only focusing on heaps, as clustered tables are a whole other beast. That physical row locator (called RID by Microsoft) is an 8 byte value comprised of 3 different segments FileID:PageID:SlotId and can be broken down into 2 bytes for the FileId, 4 bytes for the PageId and 2 bytes for the SlotId (Delaney et al., 2013, p. 311).\nThe relevant point here: a row ID will contain the slot number of the row and this row ID will appear in all non-clustered indexes. Which leads us to the concept behind this post.\nstable slot numbers\nBecause indexes will use the slot ID as part of the row's identifier, the system needs to guarantee that rows maintain their slot number during internal page maintenance operations. If rows were to be assigned to other slots, all non-clustered indexes would also require an update, which would be pretty bad performance wise.\nThe most direct implication of this rule is for the process of page compaction but, as I've noticed, the journey to guarantee this rule starts with deletions.\nrow deletions\nOne of the advantages abstracting the access to rows through the slot array is that certain operations such as deletions become trivial. Similar to how a file system works, deletion from a slotted page does not require us to touch the actual row data. Instead, it is enough to invalidate the slot pointing to that row, thus making the area of bytes corresponding to the row completely unreachable.\nThe process is quite simple, but what does it mean to invalidate a slot? In my case, it is just a matter of setting both its offset and length fields to 0, while keeping the slot count from the header untouched:\n\nThis implementation adheres to the stable slot numbers rule:\n\nif, instead of invalidating the slot, we would have deleted it from the array completely (and decremented slot_count), we would have had to shift the next slots one index down, thus blatantly breaking the rule\nif we set it to (0,0) as we are doing now, but decremented the slot_count, we would have made the last valid slot unreachable.\n\nTurns out this rule logically simplified the implementation by quite a lot. The only more complex part of deletion is a small optimization I've added: if the row being deleted is physically the last on the page (so right at the end of the data section), we can actually avoid leaving the page fragmented by moving the free_start pointer to the end of the previous row (physically). If this is the happy case, the can_compact flag is also not set in the header to indicate fragmentation has started.\nI had actually missed doing this in the Rust implementation (despite me having done it in the Java db which was open on the other display) and I only realized it when I was trying to do the setup for some insertion tests - I initially marked the scenarios as 'technically possible, but not valid', until I gave it some more thought and discovered that they are in reality impossible only if this optimization is implemented (you can still see the comment where I marked them as impossible)\npage compaction\nThe process of internally reorganizing the records in the page, in order to remove fragmentation. While all pages start off as tightly packed arrays where all rows are in a contiguous chunk of bytes, deletions and updates can lead to small fragments of bytes appearing in between rows. As a result, a page's free space counter might be high, but without any contiguous area of space large enough to fit a new row.\nCompaction is done by moving all the existing rows next to each other, thus removing any fragments.\nIt is usually a lazy process, performed when an insertion cannot find any large enough fragment to fit the new row.\nMy implementation for it might not be the most optimal, but it seems to work. I allocate a new byte array the size of the data segment (free_start - header_size), go through the slot array and for each valid slot, copy the row in the new byte array, packing them one after the other &amp; updating the slot offset value. Then I just overwrite the data segment with the new byte array (which will have some trailing 0s, as many as there were bytes from fragments).\nI'm sure there is some fancier in-place approach where you don't need to temporarily allocate a new array of up to 4k bytes, but that is more of a nice-to-have, later-on-if-i-ever-get-to-it optimization. Especially since this implementation checks the most important box: it does not break the rule of stable slot numbers. Funnily enough, the initial implementation in Java was to actually allocate a whole new page and only copy the valid slots, then replace the current page's byte array (a hacky way of leveraging the insertion algorithm without having to think too much). It was only while discussing the whole process with a friend almost a year later that we realized how the approach violated this rule. So maybe that's why I'm writing about it.\noutro\nThat is mostly it for this post, which turned out to be way longer than I expected anyways. As I said in the beginning, things have been moving pretty slowly during the last few weeks, but they should pick up now that the holidays are over.\nI've also been working on is a nicer infrastructure for testing - my goal for this project is to try and add tests for everything as I am writing the code, to avoid having to cover tens of scenarios later on. I've been looking into ways in which I can leverage some of the features of Rust to create helpers for this module that will make the setup of any test scenario a breeze - but I think I will cover that in another post.\nOne other thing that has kept me busy has been the insertion algorithm - the Java implementation was quite chunky, so I've been splitting it into smaller pieces, cleaning them up (and trying to cover them as much as possible).\nAs next steps, I will hopefully finish the things related to heap pages pretty soon. Then I need to decide whether I want to stay in the storage engine and work on things like index pages (and the monstrous B+trees), or to expand into the other modules.\nMost likely I am going to go with the second. This whole process is quite slow, not due to the differences between the two languages, but because at every step I am questioning many of the implementation details from the Java db, trying to improve things or to solve shortcomings. Because of this, going through all the layers with a small working prototype might make decisions easier when I revisit them to complete the MVP. And on a subjective side of things, I'd like to have a working prototype as soon as possible.\nreferences\n\nDelaney, K., Beauchemin, B., Cunningham, C., Kehayias, J., Freeman, C., Nevarez, B., &amp; Randal, P.

In this post, I will go over database pages, the universally adopted abstraction for how the engine interacts with the disk. The theoretical part of the article does not propose any new design, but rather summarizes how databases typically structure and use pages. I then walk through my own implementation of database pages, which, while custom-built, follows closely the structure and behavior described in the theoretical overview.\nWhy pages\nA database page (also referred to as a block) is the fundamental unit of storage and I/O inside most database engines. Instead of reading or writing arbitrary bytes, the database organizes its files into fixed-size blocks - generally 4 KB to 16 KB - that contain a header, records (rows) or index entries, and free space.\nPages are the basis for how data is stored on disk, cached in memory, and manipulated by internal components such as B-trees, buffer pools, and write-ahead logging.\nDatabases use pages because they provide deterministic control over I/O. Fixed-size blocks allow the engine to align with disk hardware, optimize sequential reads, minimize fragmentation and avoid expensive random access. This also makes caching predictable: a buffer pool can simply hold X frames, each corresponding to exactly one page, allowing clearer decisions about eviction, tracking dirty pages, and pinning.\nPages also decouple the database from operating system memory management. Relying on the OS pages or the OS cache would make eviction, flushing, and write ordering unpredictable or outside the control of the engine. Databases need to know exactly when a block has been written, how to track its state relative to the write-ahead log, and how to restore it after a crash. Having their own page format and buffer management system gives them full control over these constraints.\nThe page abstraction is also essential for data structures like B-trees and for space management within tables. Each index node fits within a single page, making lookups and modifications more efficient. More on B-tree backed indexes in a later post.\nAs with many other areas and modules, the OS is the enemy of the engine, and the database will choose to implement its own mechanisms, rather than relying on the OS provided abstractions in order to be able to optimize and define its behavior exactly as it wants it.\nSlotted pages\nThe most common implementation for this is called a slotted page. The reasoning behind this concept is explained in the Why slotted pages section - but first I will quickly go over the structure and the behavior of this kind of page by using my design as an example.\nStructure and behavior\nI have configured a page to be 4KB in size - I have chosen this size mostly because it is more manageable to look through while debugging and because I do most of my work on a Macbook with an SSD that has a 4KB block size as well, so that matches nicely.\nPages are basically a contiguous chunk of 4096 bytes structured as a 96-byte header, immediately followed by a data region growing right (or down) and ending with a slot array growing left (or up):\n\nHeader\nThe header represents the first 96 bytes of the page and stores metadata about the page itself: the total number of slots that are currently in use, the amount of free space remaining on the page, the type of the page (simple heap data page, index page, etc), various flags (e.g., fragmentation),  pointers to the sibling pages (in the case of index pages).\nThese are stored as different data types: for example, a 16 bit integer is enough to store the total number of rows in the page - we can never expect to have a large number of rows. Flags require even fewer bits, while other fields like sibling pointer might require more.\nSlots\nThe idea behind the slotted page is pretty simple: whenever you insert a row, you place it wherever there is some room in the page, then you create a new entry in the slot array - this entry will store the offset at which the row starts and its length. The row is now identified by its slot number.\nReading\nBecause the slots are fixed size (4 bytes in my case - 2 for the offset, 2 for the length), it is trivial to read directly the i-th slot - e.g. reading slot at index 3 simply means positioning your read-head at PAGE_SIZE - (slot_number + 1) * SLOT_SIZE = 4096 - (3 + 1) * 4 = 4080, then reading the first 4 bytes (in the image above, that would give us the slot (140, 12)).\nIterating over all the rows in the page is equally simple - you just iterate over the slot array, dereference each slot and output the corresponding row.\nUpdating\nAs said, inserting a new row means finding some free space in the page and creating a new slot.\nDeletion, on the other hand, is straightforward - you can just delete (or invalidate) the slot - deleting the actual bytes of the row is optional and can be postponed, since that segment of the page is no longer accessible and will eventually be overwritten. A process called compaction will rearrange all the existing rows in a contiguous segment, removing any fragmentation that may have occurred after deletions.\nAs for updating, if the new row has the same size (or smaller), the update can be done in place. If it's greater, the updated value will need to be placed somewhere else in the page and the slot's offset will be updated - the slot number, however, will remain unchanged.\nWhy slotted pages\nThe way I see it, slotted pages solve two main problems:\n\nHow to handle variable length rows\nHow to encapsulate storage details from outside objects\n\nVariable length rows\nSay we didn't have slotted pages, but wanted to store rows that vary in length. How would we do that? The most direct approach would be to store them as [ row_length | row_bytes]- e.g. [ 5 | 'hello']. This allows you to know exactly how many bytes you need to read to obtain a single row.\nBut what about random access? What happens if you need to read the 3-rd row? You have no idea where it starts exactly, so you need to: read the length of row 1, move the cursor at current + row_1_length, read the length of row 2, move the cursor at current + row_2_length, then finally read the row you need.\nThis can become cumbersome and inefficient.\nWith slots on the other hand, because they are fixed size, you can determine exactly where the 3rd slot is stored, which will point you to where the row itself is stored. In our case, the 3rd slot (index = 2) will be placed at PAGE_SIZE - (index + 1) * SLOT_SIZE = 4096 - 3 * 4 = 4084. By computing this offset and setting the read head at that location, we are able to directly read the two shorts that compose the slot.\nEncapsulating the details\nThe other advantage of slots is that it allows you to hide from the outside world the way the page organizes itself underneath.\nAgain, say we didn't have the slot array.\nIf you look at the drawing of the page from the start of the post, you might notice that row 3 is missing because it was deleted.\nHow would we handle the page operations now, say, for reading row #4? We would read row 1, then row 2 - and then? We would need some sort of pointer to indicate that we need to skip some bytes to be able to get to what is labelled as row 4, but in reality, is the now 3rd row. Or we would need to compact (remove fragmentation) on each delete.\nBut if we were to compact on each delete - this means that row 4 now becomes row 3. This can become quite problematic. What if there is an index out there for this table? We would need to not only remove the old row from it, but also update rows 4, 5, 6, ... to become rows 3, 4, 5, ...\nThe problem is that the logical ordering of the rows is dependent on the physical ordering and organization on disk.\nThis is very limiting and causes dependencies left and right. Even if external objects don't know the exact offset of the row, they are dependent on the place where it is stored and rows themselves are dependent on one another.\nSlots allow us to hide all of these details from the outside world.\nBy only exposing the slot numbers to external objects, we are free to organize the rows however we want - fragmented, compacted, in increasing or decreasing order of their size, all even and all odd, does not matter because the slot array stays constant. Deleting a row and compacting the page means moving around the only the row data - the slots stay unchanged. If you consult the drawing again, you will notice that the 3rd slot is (0,0) - that is because the row was deleted and the slot invalidated, but not removed from the array. This means that after a compaction, the space that was occupied by the row will be overwritten, but the (0,0) slot will remain in the array.\nAs a result, row 4 will remain row 4, regardless of where it is stored in the page, so external objects like indexes will not be affected by any internal reorganization of the page.\nImplementation\nJava\nThe original Java implementation defined a class called SlottedPage which contained a ByteBuffer of size 4096 with the actual content from disk. It also exposed numerous methods for interacting with the page - reading and writing flags from the header, retrieving, inserting or updating rows, etc. Additionally, a SortedPage class extended the SlottedPage and offered overrides for B-tree index nodes.\nThis grew a bit cumbersome for several reasons:\n\nInheritance sometimes sucks - had a bug I spent several days fixing, only because I was expecting an object to be a SortedPage, but was in reality an unsorted SlottedPage, which broke some B-tree invariants. This could have been prevented by a better implementation or by paying more attention, but I feel my point still stands.\nThe classes grew quite big - exposing a different method for every header value, every behavior - this led to large objects.\n(A me problem) Not a lot of attention paid to data duplication - there were flows where the main byte array of the page was duplicated and copied around as it was passed from method to method.\n\nRust\nThe new implementation is pretty similar conceptually to the Java one. However, in a Rust-centric approach I tried to focus more on the ownership side of things and ensure that the data is not duplicated in memory for no good reason. I also leveraged the fact that you can have multiple impl blocks across different files for the same struct - this allowed me to group methods in different files based on their functionality.\nThe next question was how to actually store the page bytes in memory and how it would play along with the buffer. The way I saw it, I had two main possible directions:\n\nThe page owns the byte array, while the buffer cache owns the pages via some data structure.\nThe buffer manager allocates and owns a pool of frames where each page is placed -&gt; then the page is only a pointer to that memory region.\n\nBased on my research, the second option seems more popular or idiomatic. I chose, however, to go with the first one because it felt easier to avoid doing all that pointer arithmetic on the buffer pool &amp; dealing with lifetimes. In a way it also felt more modern &amp; more Rust (might be wrong here tho).\nThe base of it all is the Page struct:\n\nThe page_id is just an in-memory page identifier comprised of filename_hash::page_number_within_file. Only the page number within the file is stored in the page header - the filename itself will be known through the use of system catalogs.\nThe data field stores the main byte array of the page in a Box on the heap. I chose an actual array over something like a Vec as the size will never change so the overhead of the Vec seemed unnecessary.\nHeaderRef and HeaderMut\nThe first order of business was to provide access to the header of the page. Instead of going with a set of getters and setters on the main page, I decided to create two new structs, HeaderRef and HeaderMut:\n\nThese structures borrow from the main page byte array a slice the size of the header - namely the first 96 bytes. HeaderRef offers an immutable view into the header of the page via getters, while HeaderMut offers a mutable view via getters and setters. The word view here is relevant to me - that is because these structs are zero-copy - they do not duplicate the underlying byte array in any way. Because their slices are also limited to the header size, they cannot affect the rest of the page, should there be any bug. I also decided to split them in mutable and immutable to keep the trend of Rust - if you want to modify something, you should opt in for the mutable one.\nThe getters and setters are implemented via a macro that takes as param the flag/value name and data type, to avoid having to write a large number of methods manually.\nSlotArrayRef and SlotArrayMut\nSimilarly to the header, I also provide access to the slot array via the following structs:\n\nThe reasoning here is the same: slice into the main array and encapsulate behavior in a more organized and testable way.\nThese structs are instantiated with a slice the size of the slot array at the time of its creation: if the page contains 3 slots, the slice will be 3*4 bytes, or more precisely the last 12 bytes of the page.\nThey offer methods for retrieving slots, and in the case of SlotArrayMut, insert/update slots.\nThey also expose the slot structs - a zero-copy view of a single slot:\n\nPage API\nWith the exception of the main Page struct, all behavior and structs are internal to the page crate. The page exposes a set of public methods that are accessible outside of the crate - for creation of the page itself and for retrieval/insertion/deletion/update of rows. Underneath, these public methods leverage this structs and encapsulate the behavior of the page. The main impl blocks are split into separate files: one for reading rows, one for inserting, etc. All of these internal methods can be tested in place where needed.\nError handling\nI tried to create an error enum for every main flow: InsertError, ReadRowError, etc. Underneath, these are derivable for more concrete errors: all header operations can return HeaderError, all slot operations can return SlotError, etc.\nAll of these errors can be converted to a PageOpError, which represents the crate's catch-all error type:\n\nAdditionally, the PageError is the crate's public error type and the only one exposed to the outside world.\nIt is a struct containing a PageOpError and an additional PageId. A trait to more easily attach the page id is also implemented:\n\nRemaining work\nAt the time of writing this, only the insertion and retrieval of rows has been implemented (besides the header &amp; slot array accessors). I started by taking the Java implementation as-is and translated it to Rust and right now I am trying to improve it by (1) splitting it into more granular and testable chunks, (2) optimizing and improving the overall logic. After that, I will apply the same principle to compaction, deletion &amp; updates.\nWorth noting tho, this only covers heap unsorted pages. The B-tree index pages are a whole other thing that will be tackled separately, but that might be pushed a bit further down the priority list.\nResources\nThese resources helped inform my understanding of database page architecture:\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server Documentation — Pages and Extents Architecture Guide\nKalen Delaney — Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Internals\nCMU Intro to databases\n\n","description":"An overview of the concept of slotted pages in a storage engine along with details on how it was implemented","id":"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/paging-the-data/","path":"/blog/rusting-a-database/paging-the-data/","title":"Paging the data"},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/so-i-decided-to-write-a-database/":{"body":"About a year ago I started a personal project to implement a relational database system from scratch, mostly as a result of (1) my interest in the field and (2) a desire to better understand how things work under the hood.\nProfessionally, I’ve been working for the past 7.5 years as a .NET backend engineer. A lot of my recent tasks involved attempting to improve the response time of a SQL Server database, which led me to spend quite some time looking at queries, execution plans, and schema design, trying to find the culprit behind the performance issue. I kept reading articles and blogs about random operators and how they work to try and grasp what was happening to my query.\nThe idea of writing some sort of database &amp; query engine kept bouncing around in my head more like a conceptual thing - I wonder how difficult it would be to implement a JOIN - until one day last fall when I was telling a friend about this over FaceTime, and we decided to make a go of it. We chose Java over something like C++ mostly because (a) it was a language we are both familiar with, C# being quite similar in many aspects, and (b) writing a database engine is hard enough - we wanted to focus on the design and functionality, not on also getting familiar with a low-level language at the same time.\nAfter one year of active development, I started feeling a bit stuck. Some of the design choices I made turned out not to be the best, which led me to create several tasks tagged with refactor and XXL. Looking at the impact these refactors would bring, it felt easier to cut my losses, learn from my mistakes, and re-work everything from scratch rather than make the changes in place.\nThat decision also meant choosing a new direction for the implementation itself - not just a redesign, but a complete rewrite. I still didn't particularly want to go the C++ route, but I did want something closer to how actual database systems are implemented, so I chose to learn Rust for this new version.\nSince I’m redoing the whole thing anyway, I figured I might as well make use of everything I learned the first time around. One of the lessons was that I didn’t do a great job documenting my thought process or why I made certain choices. This time I want to change that, and having a place to write things down from the very beginning might help.\nThis blog will follow my journey of learning Rust by re-implementing my initial database server. I’ll cover design choices and approaches I’ve taken for the engine, along with Rust-specific things I’ve used to implement them (or that I find cool). I know I’ll make plenty of mistakes - both Rust-specific and DB engine ones - but I guess that’s the whole point: I’ve been programming for long enough to know that you rarely get the right solution on the first attempt. I don’t regret any of the wrong choices from the Java project - by having made them, I’ve learned a lot more. Same goes for the way I’ve implemented things in the few hundred lines of Rust code I’ve already written for this - I’m sure many of them will come back and bite me a few months from now, but that is part of the process I’ve learned to accept and actually enjoy.\nI use various resources when designing the system: lectures I find on YouTube from various universities, several books, documentation, and (very little) open source code like PostgreSQL or SQLite. Many of the design choices are influenced by SQL Server (through observation &amp; Microsoft’s public documentation) mostly because it’s the system I’m most familiar with and enjoy the most. However, I try to use these resources only to guide me in the right direction and have the actual implementation be as much my own as possible.\nThis database project will never see the light of day as an actual product to be used in real life - I don’t see the point in trying to create a competitor for existing solutions with decades of experience on the market (especially as a side project done by one person after work). It’s designed for my own growth and passion.\nI do welcome any kind of feedback from anyone reading this - whether I’ve made a stupid choice regarding the design/behavior of the database engine, or if I’ve written some junk piece of Rust code that can be improved. Appreciation of anything that looks right is also more than welcome :D\nThe repo with the Rust code can be found here. cargo generated docs can be found here\n","description":"First post, going over the reason behind this blog and giving some context.","id":"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/so-i-decided-to-write-a-database/","path":"/blog/rusting-a-database/so-i-decided-to-write-a-database/","title":"So I decided to write a database system"},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/storage-manager-the-buffer/":{"body":"Intro\nHaving finished at least a preliminary implementation of the slotted pages, it is time to move on to the next part of the storage subsystem: its managers.\nIn the original implementation, there were three of them:\n\nFile manager: handling the I/O with the file system\nBuffer manager: implementing the page buffer\nStorage manager: providing access into the storage system\nThe approach for Rust will be similar — the plan is to have the same three services. The lesson learned from Java being that the storage manager in particular can easily slip into having more responsibilities than it should. As a general rule, no service in the storage subsystem should deal with anything more granular than a page.\n\nThe buffer\nWhile the storage manager provides access to the entire module, the buffer manager is more interesting and far more important; therefore, I have started with it.\nThe page buffer (or page cache) is one of the more important components of the engine.

It is also an important player in the implementation of the whole steal/no force ARIES algorithm and the entire logging &amp; transactionality approach - none of which I will cover in this post, as they are complex topics that require their own separate analysis.\nFor the purpose of this stage, though, the buffer manager plays a simpler role: caching data pages after they have been read from disk and providing callers access to them when requested. For now, we will keep to a minimum more advanced features like dirty page tracking, automatic flushing, pin counting and real eviction policies. These will be implemented later, the goal right now being to implement a buffer manager that is extensible, stable, and meets several requirements.\nThe requirements\nBefore designing the buffer, I needed to clarify what the expectations of it are. They can be summarized as follows:\n\nthe buffer should be the owner of the cached data pages and the only place in memory where the pages exist (i.e. do not allow page data to be cloned/duplicated/copied)\ncallers request a page by its PageID and receive a reference to the page data\nthe buffer is responsible for negotiating with the FileManager to trigger disk reads when a requested page is not found in the cache\nthe implementation will allow concurrent access in a classic R/W locking mechanism:\n\nread access to a page can be provided to any number of threads\nwrite access to a page is exclusive\nread/write access is controlled at the page level, not the entire buffer (multiple threads can obtain write access at the same time, provided they are working with different data pages)\n\n\n\nThe old design\nI started off with a design similar to the one in the Java implementation: the buffer contains a HashMap&lt;PageId, Page&gt;. Given that no concurrent implementation was present in the Java version, this worked fine.\nThis time around, besides the desire to design the buffer with concurrency in mind, I was also limited by the constraints imposed by the borrow checker. While defining a HashMap&lt;PageId, Page&gt; is possible, there were several problems with this approach:\n\nnot thread safe - we would need some approach that allows concurrency:\n\nif we only protected the pages (HashMap&lt;PageId, RwLock&lt;Page&gt;&gt;), access to the map itself would still not be thread safe\nif we also protected the map (RwLock&lt;HashMap&lt;PageId, RwLock&lt;&lt;Page&gt;&gt;&gt;), we would also bottleneck access to it - no thread could access it to read page X while another thread was attempting to insert page Y\n\n\nmutability - since even read operations can require mutation (in case of a cache miss, read from disk and insert in cache), the borrow checker will heavily block our attempts - every operation would require a mutable borrow of the map, which realistically is not doable.\n\nThe new solution\nIn order to solve all the problems caused by the old approach, I did the following:\n\nseparate the task of caching pages from keeping track of what pages are cached\nuse interior mutability\n\nThe first one is relatively straightforward: instead of attempting to have a single data structure that both owns the pages and keeps track of them, I split the responsibilities over two structures: a pure cache and a page map.\nInterior mutability, a pattern that allows you to change the internal state of a type through a shared reference, is used in both structures and provides a way of updating the contents of the buffer manager via &amp;BufferManager, without the need to borrow it mutably (&amp;mut BufferManager). Since we are dealing with a multithreaded context, Mutex and RwLock (in combination with Arc) were used.\nThe following diagram shows the high level design:\n\nFrames\nTo achieve this desired result, a different approach was taken compared to the Java implementation: instead of thinking of the buffer as a collection in which we place new pages, we can see it as a pre-allocated chunk of memory in which pages are loaded from disk. This is done through a fixed-size block of memory allocated at startup and comprised of multiple frames, each frame being able to store a single page.\nThis has an important consequence: the cache structure itself is never mutated after construction. Its size stays constant regardless of the content it stores and how it is updated throughout its lifetime.\nLet's take a look at this part of the implementation:\n\nThe BufferFrame is a simple structure that owns the data page and protects it with a RwLock. This means that we never need to borrow the frame mutably in order to change the content of the underlying page. The same logic applies for the PageID, the only difference being that the Option allows us to flag that the frame is empty.\nThanks to this, the buffer can only own a Vec&lt;BufferFrame&gt;, without the need for additional thread protection. This is based on the fact that access to a Vec is thread-safe as long as the vector itself is not mutated (which we're not doing): a Vec&lt;T,A&gt; is Sync if T, A: Sync and Send if T, A: Send [2]\nAt startup, a fixed-size Vec is allocated, and each frame instantiated with default values: None for page_id, a zeroed-out page, 0 for pin_count and false for dirty.\nWorth noting, a zeroed-out page does not mean the lack of one - in each frame, we have an instantiated Page struct with all of its 4096 bytes set to zero.\nWhen a page is requested, it is read from disk directly into the frame.page.data byte array, thus populating the frame without mutating the overall data structure.\nNote: the page_id field of the frame is only used as an indicator that the frame is occupied, not as a mechanism of keeping track of what pages are currently in the cache.\nPage map\nOnce we have sorted out how to have the buffer own and store the data pages themselves, we need a way to determine which pages we actually have in the cache.\nFor this, we employ a new field and some data types:\n\nI'll break this down bottom-up:\nA frame is identified by its index in the Vec, thus a FrameId is just a nicer way of defining that usize to make it clearer.\nThe PageState enum tells us whether the page is in the buffer, ready to be accessed at the given FrameId, or if it is currently being read from disk. See the Race conditions 2.1 for an explanation of why this is needed.\nThe PageEntry is used as the value in the page_map. The use of the Mutex and Condvar is also described in the Race conditions 2.2 section. Suffice to say for both that they protect the resources during concurrent access.\nThe page_map field is a map from PageID to its corresponding PageEntry. Here, we do need to have a RwLock protecting the map, as we will be mutating it during runtime: when a new page is loaded into a frame, we update the map with a new key-value pair.\nThe value of the map is wrapped in an Arc to limit the duration of the lock on the entire collection, allowing us to do the following:\n\nBy cloning the Arc, we can drop the lock on the map and allow other threads to access it if needed. This way, even if we do need to lock the whole collection while mutating it, we can keep the locks as short as possible.\nWithout the Arc, map.get would have given us a &amp;PageEntry that was tied to the guard from the RwLock.\nRequesting pages\nSo far we have covered the way the buffer is defined in terms of state, but what about behavior? How does this design affect the functional implementation?\nThe three main operations I will be covering are: requesting a page to be read, requesting a page to be updated and requesting a new page. The buffer will, of course, offer more functionality in the future, but these are the important ones.\nThe operations are defined as follows:\n\nThe methods return custom data types, defined as follows:\n\nRemember that each BufferFrame protects the underlying Page with a RwLock. To get through the lock, you need to own a RwLockReadGuard or RwLockWriteGuard. Therefore, the buffer cannot hand out references to the Page itself:\n\nIt can, however, go into the frame, request a guard from the lock and return that to the caller. This way, as long as the caller keeps ownership of the guard, it has access to the page.\nAnd since this is a RwLock, it automatically handles shared and exclusive access.\nThe implementation of Deref and DerefMut means we can invoke methods of the Page directly on the guard.\nWhat this design achieves\nIf we look again at the requirements, we can see that this design satisfies them:\n\nbuffer is owner of a Vec&lt;BufferFrame&gt;, where each BufferFrame owns the page\ncallers receive a guard that is dereferenced to a &amp;Page or &amp;mut Page\nbuffer reads pages into memory when they are not already cached\nconcurrent R/W access to the pages is provided and thread safe\n\nmultiple RwLockReadGuards are allowed at once\na single guard of type RwLockWriteGuard is allowed\nmultiple locks on different pages are allowed at the same time. The only serialization of operations is done when mutating the page_map, but through Arc&lt;PageEntry&gt; we can keep these locks as short as possible\n\n\n\nNote: here I have used the term locks multiple times. In reality, these would be more correctly called latches - primitive synchronization mechanisms that control access to a physical resource. Down the line, we will implement a LockManager, which will handle logical locks at object level during the execution of a transaction, while the latches will maintain the consistency of the in-memory objects and prevent corruption during multithreaded operations.\nConclusions and lessons learned\nThe implementation of the buffer is still in a very premature state - only the most basic of features have been done. However, I think it provides a pretty good foundation for what will come next. I’ve done a bit of testing (both automated tests and manual testing) and the concurrency seems to be handled correctly, allowing multiple threads to access the same page.\nOne of the interesting aspects has been the difference in approaches I was forced to take compared to the Java implementation - in there, the buffer itself was a very direct implementation of a HashMap, with little extra thought being given to it in terms of data structures or actual definition. Here, because the borrow checker did not allow me to just do the first thing that crossed my mind, I needed to stop for a moment and actually think about how I wanted this component to work - who should own the pages, where to give out references and what rules to apply to the entire flow. While this has taken a far longer time, I'm pretty confident the result is more robust. And I'm not saying this to preach Rust necessarily - the same solution could be done in any language, if you choose to do it, whereas in Rust you are somewhat forced to do it. But coming from C#, this is still an interesting aspect for me.\nAdditional resources\nRace conditions\nAs mentioned, I identified a few possible edge case race conditions that shaped the design:\n1. Two threads look for an empty frame\nWe must ensure that if two threads are searching for an empty frame in which to load a page, they do not choose the same one.\nSolution\nWhen going through the frames, write-lock the one you find empty and set its page_id from the start. This way, you can release the lock without worrying that others might use it before you get the chance to load the page.\n2.1 One right after the other, two threads want to read the same page\nThe first thread sets the page_id on the frame, but before it has the chance to load the page, the other attempts to read the page.\nSolution\nTo determine if a page is cached, always consult the page_map, never the frames.page_id. Additionally, publish in the page_map that the page is available only after successfully loading it from disk.\n2.2 Two threads want to load the same page in different frames\nHere, we need to ensure that the 2nd thread can differentiate between page not in cache and page being loaded into cache.\nSolution\nThe use of the PageEntry with the two states (Loading and Ready(FrameId)) allows a thread to signal to others that it is currently reading the page from disk. It must insert the pair in the page_map before starting the I/O and set it to Loading. The second thread will notice that and wait on the Mutex from the PageEntry. Once the loader thread has finished reading the data from disk, it can update the state to Ready(FrameId) and notify the waiting 2nd thread. Through the use of a Condvar, the 2nd thread was not busy-waiting or consuming CPU while waiting for the event to occur.\nNote: here, it is important in the 1st thread to obtain the read/write guard on the page before updating the map and notifying the waiters. Otherwise, the 2nd thread might wake up and snatch the lock on the page from the first thread which did all the work of reading the data from the disk.\nStorage access times\nThis table shows the access times for different storage/memory components, with an equivalent conversion in a more tangible unit of time. I find the table very relevant as it highlights just how slow disk reads are, especially compared to RAM and the CPU caches\nSourceDurationEquivalent duration\nL1 cache0.5 ns0.5 sec\nL2 cache7ns7 sec\nDRAM100ns100 sec\nSSD150_000ns1.7 days\nHDD10_000_000ns16.5 weeks\nNetwork storage30_000_000ns11.4 months\n\nSource: [1]\nReferences\n\nPavlo, A.

Most of the open source code I was consulting (PostgreSQL, SQLite) was C++, but for my entire professional career I’ve been working with managed, garbage-collected, runtime-based languages, quite far away in my perspective from a systems language. I did some C/C++ in college, but going from that to being able to write an entire project of this scale with it would have meant putting the database on hold for quite a while.\nThen I started looking into Rust, which felt like a good middle ground between what I knew and where I wanted to get. Manually allocating memory without the fear of a SEGFAULT sounded like a good segue into this type of programming. Knowing that the borrow checker sits beside me and does not allow me to make blatant mistakes sounded like a nice to have safety net.\nAfter a crash course of going through the official Rust book, doing the Rustlings exercises, and several small test apps, I decided the best way to actually improve my Rust skills was to get to work and hope I'll pick up stuff along the way.\nI’m putting all of this out here partly to keep track of what I’m doing, and partly because I’m sure someone out there will know better and point things out - whether that’s spotting issues I missed or suggesting better ways of implementing things.\n","description":"Why I chose Rust for the rewrite of this project","id":"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/why-rust/","path":"/blog/rusting-a-database/why-rust/","title":"Why rust"},"https://tudor96stani.com/series/":{"body":"\nRusting a Database\n\n","description":"","id":"https://tudor96stani.com/series/","path":"/series/","title":"Series"}},"docInfo":{"https://tudor96stani.com/":{"body":4,"description":0,"path":0,"title":2},"https://tudor96stani.com/about/":{"body":61,"description":0,"path":0,"title":0},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/":{"body":3,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/":{"body":29,"description":0,"path":3,"title":2},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/crates/":{"body":186,"description":16,"path":4,"title":1},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/insertion-in-heap-pages/":{"body":595,"description":6,"path":6,"title":3},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/maintaining-stable-row-identifiers-during-page-maintenance/":{"body":803,"description":13,"path":10,"title":7},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/paging-the-data/":{"body":1481,"description":9,"path":5,"title":2},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/so-i-decided-to-write-a-database/":{"body":448,"description":9,"path":6,"title":4},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/storage-manager-the-buffer/":{"body":1353,"description":10,"path":6,"title":3},"https://tudor96stani.com/blog/rusting-a-database/why-rust/":{"body":155,"description":4,"path":4,"title":1},"https://tudor96stani.com/series/":{"body":2,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1}},"length":12},"lang":"English"}
