Hi, I'm Tudor. I'm a software engineer based in Romania. 

I've been working as a dotnet backend developer since mid 2018, in the medical software industry.

I've created this blog as a way for me to share the things I discover and find interesting, both during my day to day and and while working on personal projects. 

My main areas of interest (at the moment) are relational databases and compilers.

My other passions include sports - I like running and swimming. I do quite a bit of reading & spend a lot of time watching Youtube videos about HiFi audio systems I will never afford.
